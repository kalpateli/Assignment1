        <h1>Pencils</h1>
        <p>Pencils are one of the most popular writing and drawing instruments and are available in a variety of different pencil types. Pencils are used by millions each day, but have you ever wondered where the pencil came from?

            The very first pencil was discovered by the Romans and was called a stylus, and they used it as an effective writing tool. The stylus was a thin metal rod that gave stability in creating a readable mark that the scribes used to deposit on the papyrus.</p>
